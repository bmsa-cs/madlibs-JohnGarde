#story
print(f"     It was a/an {adj_a} day when I woke up. The stars had ended their nightshift and it was time for me to begin my day. Nothing spectacular was happening today, so I walked {verb_a} down the stairs to pour my milk {before_after} adding my cereal, {cereala}. I put in my earbuds and turned on \"{song_name}\" by Bob Marley. After finishing my breakfast, I headed up stairs to put on some jeans and a/an {band_name} shirt. I wanted to match with the "+ band_name_b + " " + obj_a + f" I'd be bringing to school. When I arrived at school, I noticed that everything looked droopy. A rift in space time opened up and the {magic} Queen came through. Or atleast that's what she called herself.\n     \"hello, hero. I have come seeking your expertise in the art of saving the world we call \'{place_a}.\'\"\n     \"You have the wrong place,\" I replied to the {place_a} Queen as I certianly wasn't the hero she was looking for, \"Go ask around for someone named \"{name}.\"\n     She seemed to be fine with this and left through her rift back to her world never to be seen again. Or atleast for today while she thinks I'm not {name_b}. Though it was odd she didn't stick around to look for {name} and left really quickly. I realized I was late for class and so I began to {verb_b} to class to be on time.\n     When I got to class, I realized that {name_c} was missing. It wouldn't make sense for him to skip class as he was a top student with top grades, and he certainly didn't get his job at {place_c} yet as he was still underage at {num}. Though to be fair, that never stopped him before, but it certainly would stop him today. I walked out of class to go look for him as our teacher, Mr. {last_name} hadn't arrived yet. The portrait of {famous_person} seemed to be following me however everytime I passed by it in the {house_part}. Increasingly curious, I tore it down with the force of a thousand {obj_b} to discover a hidden room.\n     I decided to climb through and see where it led to which I was surprised to find a sign that read \"Welcome to {place_a}! Population {num_b}.\" I deduced that this must be the place that the {magic} Queen comes from.  Looking around more, I found what must be her {building} in the distance and decided to see if that would be where she'd taken {name_c}.\n     When I got there, I realized I was right as she was giving him some type of monologue while handing him some type of {adj_b} sword. I came in like I was objecting someone's {event} and practically dragged {name_c} back while the Queen didn't try to stop me. I told him he was stupid for listening to her as I slowly started to realize that this wasn't real and was only a dream. I only found out when he hit me and I didn't feel any sort of pain.\n     As soon as I realized this, I was woken by my mother was calling me from downstairs telling me to get ready for school as I would be late if I don't move quick enough. That would be the last time I mix all the Monster Energy Drink Flavors with Red Bull when {famous_person_b} says it'd be a good idea.")
